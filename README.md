# CytoDRAV
Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization for Flow Cytometry

## Installation
If you are on a linux system please skip to step 2.
I have not tested this with Windows but as long as you can make and gcc you can install CytoDRAV. 
1. Launch a terminal session (&#x2318; + spacebar -> "terminal") and check to see if XCode Command Line tools are installed by running the following command 
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    You will either see a statement:
    ```
    xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, 
    use "Software Update" to install updates
    ```
    or a window will pop-up prompting you to install the command line tools. Complete this installation before proceeding.
2. After installing R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/), in the terminal you already have open, run the command `R`. This will start an interactive R session. Run the following commands to install devtools and CytoDRAV
   ```
   if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
   devtools::install_github("ReevesLab/CytoDRAV", ref="PkgDev", force=T, dependencies=T)
   ```
   This command will progress through the required packages. It may prompt you for input, please select accordingly and make sure that if it asks for you to install Bioconductor, select `yes`
   
   This will install CytoDRAV and all required packages.
3. Exit the R session by typing `q()` and then entering `n` and return. 
4. In the terminal enter the following lines, hitting return after each line:
    ```
    cd ~/Desktop
    printf '#!/bin/bash\nR -e "CytoDRAV::launch_application(launch.browser=T)"' > RunCytoDRAV
    chmod +x RunCytoDRAV
    ```
5. You can now run CytoDRAV but double clicking the `RunCytoDRAV` script. This will launch a terminal window for progress and it will launch your default browser to the CytoDRAV page. 

CytoDRAV works best with 100,000 events and under. You can use more but it exponentially increases time to compute and the time to plot increases drastically. To downsample events you can either pre-downsample in FlowJo, or under the Settings tab there is a slider at the bottom to choose number of events. 10,000 events is fairly quick to compute just to demonstrate the program.
